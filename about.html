    <p>Kerala, a land of cultural diversity, is a complete whole made up of a blending of various religions, communities, regional cultures and language variations. Kerala culture can be compared to a chain made of different coloured beads and the thread through which the beads are strung is the Malayalam language. The cultural variety of Kerala was created by its unique geographic features as it lies between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats. Rich in rain forests, its ancient trade relations with foreign lands, entry of immigrant communities during different periods, agricultural tradition, cuisine and its tradition of art – literature –science and all these make the land, Kerala. 

        Though Kerala had remained as a unique cultural zone from ancient times, it became politically united with the formation of the Kerala state. This land, which lay divided into the Travancore and Kochi kingdoms, and Malabar district in the Madras Presidency under the British rule, became a single state on November 1, 1956. Kerala is bordered by Tamil Nadu on its East and South; by Karnataka on its north and north-east; and by the Arabian Sea on its west.  Lakshadweep, which is a union territory lying on the Arabian Sea and Mayyazhi, which is an enclave of Puthucherry state lying within Kerala are part of Kerala culture both in terms of language and culture.
